The UstreamPlayer will buffer the content then it will wait.\nAt this stage it is not required to call `setPlayerListener()`, `setErrorListener()` and `attach()` if the callbacks are not relevant for you.\nBut you are free to do so if you are interested in the callbacks, but make sure you call `detach()` before changing listeners or playerView on the player,\nand call `attach()` again so these changes can take effect.\n- Later when the player is needed set your listeners and the `playerView`, call `attach()`\n- Call `ustreamPlayer.play()` and if it is buffered the playback will start instantly.\n\n**Example**:\n\n```java\nUstreamPlayerFactory ustreamPlayerFactory = new UstreamPlayerFactory(API_KEY, activity);\nContentDescriptor contentDescriptor = new ContentDescriptor(ContentType.RECORDED, 123456L);\nUstreamPlayer player1 = ustreamPlayerFactory.createUstreamPlayer(contentDescriptor.toString());\nplayer1.initWithContent(contentDescriptor);\nplayer1.pause();\n\n//...
