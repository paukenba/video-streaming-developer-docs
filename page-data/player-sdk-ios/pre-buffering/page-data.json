Create a content list in priority order as soon as possible. For example, if the application contains a list of videos then the priority order may be determined based on the distance of the video cell from the screen centre. The list must contain `USMediaDescriptor` objects.\n\n2. Enqueue the content list for preparation using the `enqueueForPlaybackPreparation:` method.\n\n3. Update the list whenever it is needed by calling `enqueueForPlaybackPreparation:` with a new list. For example, when the user is scrolling up/down in the list.\n\n4. Request a `USUstreamPlayer` for a media using `playerForMedia:` when the user is initiating a playback, eg. when a video is selected.\n\n5. Present the requested player.\n\n## Notes\n- The content list can be updated freely anytime, it won't trigger re-buffering on an existing player.\n- The provided player is owned by the caller, it may be used as any other player created with `[[USUstreamPlayer alloc] init]` for example.\n- If the caller releases the player its resources will be reused for the other enqueued content.\n- If a content was not enqueued but a player is requested for it then the user will get a cold player which will start in buffering state, but it is a completely valid usage.\n- If it is appropriate, call `cancelPlaybackPreparations` to release system resources.\n- If `playerForMedia:` is called multiple times with the same `USMediaDescriptor` it will return the same player instance. You should create a different `USMediaDescriptor` object for each occurrence in order to get different players for them.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"ed92107dd417736bb417cd492ccb66bb","counter":403,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pre-Buffering","description":"Pre-Buffering"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Pre-Buffering\ndescription: Pre-Buffering\n---\n\n## Introduction\n`USPrebufferingController` provides an API allowing the buffering of content ahead of time, to support near instantaneous playback starts.\nIf you provide a content list to be prepared for playback before it is actually required to be started, you will likely get a player prepared to start the playback instantly once it is actually needed by the user of your app.\n\n## Usage\n1.
