This secret key needs to be provided by you.\n\n## Viewer authentication flow\n\nTo implement the viewer authentication flow you need to create an application that includes the following:\n\n- Screens your viewers need to go through to authenticate\n- Backend code that validates these authentication requests\n- Process to pass the authentication response to the IBM Video Streaming player\n\n![Viewer Authentication Flow](/static-content/advanced-auth-2x.png)\n![Viewer Authentication Flow](/static-content/advanced-auth2-2x.png)\n\n1.
